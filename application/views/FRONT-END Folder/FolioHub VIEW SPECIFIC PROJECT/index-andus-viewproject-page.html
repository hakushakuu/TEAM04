                     HometelRoyale is a hotel booking website developed by Elaine S. Andus. With most travelers today now booking their stays online, hotels have had to become reliant on online travel agents to deliver them reservations. Listing on them includes the benefits of reaching large, new, audiences and increasing bookings but each reservation requires a commission fee to be paid to the third-party. This website was made as a source of information for both guests and a hotel. It contains the domain name, what it offers, contact information, reviews, and all you need to learn about HometelRoyale hotel.</p>

                     Encryption vs Hashing is a tutorial video created by Elaine S. Andus. Quick, do you know the difference between encryption and hashing? Do you know what symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption are? Do you think to encrypt and to hash is almost the same? If you pay any attention to the world of cybersecurity, you’re likely to hear these terms bandied about. Oftentimes without any explanation. So, this tutorial video project I made in Information Assurance and Security tackles mainly about the differences between encryption and hashing and its algorithm.</p>

                     AndusWebsite is a portfolio website developed by Elaine S. Andus. It is becoming increasingly important for computer scientists, and other creative and professional people to have a way to showcase and promote their work. Regardless of the medium(s) you work with, a portfolio will give more people access to your work and a better idea of your abilities. So, I made this website not only for project requirement but for future purposes. My website displays my skills and projects in a robust and visual way that complements the information in my Curriculum Vitae. Another good thing it provides is, it also allows me to organize my work in one place environment.</p>
